## Overview

Guess the Imposter is a fun and social party game where players work together to identify the "Imposter" in their group. The game is played with 3 or more players, with one player being assigned the role of the Imposter. The rest of the players know a secret word, and the Imposter must guess it by listening to the clues provided. The catch? The Imposter doesn’t know the secret word, and must rely on subtle hints from the other players to figure it out — while trying not to give away the word in the process.

This web application is a passion project designed to make playing Guess the Imposter easier and more fun by providing a streamlined interface for managing players, words, and roles. It helps automate some of the game's mechanics, allowing players to focus on the fun and mystery of the game itself!
