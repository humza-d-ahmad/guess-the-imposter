We do not own the rights to the original games, trademarks, or any associated content. Our goal is simply to share the fun with others and make it easier to play.</p>
        <p>If you are the publisher or creator of any of the games this project is inspired by, and you would like to collaborate, provide feedback, or address any concerns, please feel free to get in touch. We’d love to work together and further enhance the experience.</p>
