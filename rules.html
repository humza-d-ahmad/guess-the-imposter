        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>This game is a fun and social game for 3 or more players. One player is the "Imposter," and the rest of the players know a word that is kept secret from the Imposter.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> At the start of the game, each player (except the Imposter) is given a word. The word can be a thing, person, or place. The Imposter is unaware of the word.</li>
            <li><strong>Rounds:</strong> The game is played in several rounds. In each round, every player (including the Imposter) must say one word or phrase related to the secret word. The goal is to give subtle hints to the others without giving away too much information to the Imposter.</li>
            <li><strong>Voting:</strong> After a given number of rounds, players will vote on who they think the Imposter is.</li>
            <li><strong>Imposter’s Guess:</strong> If the players correctly identify the Imposter, the Imposter is given a chance to guess what the secret word was. If the Imposter guesses correctly, they win. If the guess is incorrect, the rest of the players win.</li>
            <li><strong>Imposter Wins:</strong> If the Imposter is not correctly identified, they win the game.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Winning Conditions</h2>
        <p>The game can end in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>If the Imposter is correctly identified:</strong> The Imposter has a chance to guess the secret word. If they guess the word correctly, the Imposter wins. If they guess incorrectly, the other players win.</li>
            <li><strong>If the Imposter is not identified:</strong> The Imposter wins the game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
        <p>The word given to each player can be any noun, whether it’s a <strong>thing, person, or place</strong>. This adds a variety of possibilities to the game and makes each round exciting and challenging.</p>
